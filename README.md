# 2026-Rebuilt-RobotSim

A strategy planning simulation for the 2026 FRC game season.

## What is this?
This project is a web-based simulation environment built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It models robot movement, ball interactions, and team-based strategies on a grid-based field, providing a visual way to analyze game dynamics.

## Why is it useful?
The simulator enables teams to test and optimize gameplay strategies before building physical hardware. Key features include:
- A* pathfinding for autonomous navigation.
- Real-time scoring and ball tracking.
- Strategy evaluation based on Expected Value (EV) models.
- Support for multiple robot roles including collectors and scorers.
